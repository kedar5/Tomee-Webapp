# Tomee-Webapp
Building Distributed Systems using concepts of servlet programming, web scraping, API's, JSON, and MVC.
Building two Webapps using Tomee.
1. Project1Task1:
    - Create an index.jsp page that asks the user to enter a string of text data, and to make a choice of two hash functions using radio buttons.
    -  The hash function choices should be MD5 and SHA-256, with MD5 being the default. When the submit button is pressed a request is sent to a servlet. 
    - The servlet will compute the requested cryptographic hash value (MD5 or SHA-256) from the text transmitted by the browser. 
    - You will need to employ the Java crypto API to compute the hash of the text. 
    - The original text will be echoed back to the browser along with the name of the hash, and the hash value. 
    - The hash values sent back to the browser should be displayed in two forms: as hexadecimal text and as base 64 notation. 
3. Project1Task2:
    - A welcome screen containing a title, your name, and a drop-down menu of a limited number of dog breeds. The Submit button is used to record the user's choice. 
    - Output screen with several facts about the selected dog, which is scrapped from https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/profiles and by using the APIs from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
